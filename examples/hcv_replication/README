Notes
-----

This code is being released with very limited instructions, and may be
of limited usefulness.  Nonetheless, I am putting it out into the
world.  As Nick Barnes argued in Nature, publish your computer code:
it is good enough.  http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101013/full/467753a.html


Setup
-----

Running the replication code requires IPython, and is best
accomplished using the IPython notebook.  It also requires a
functioning installation of the DisMod-MR python code, which in turn
relies on PyMC and a number of additional python packages.

This could all be streamlined.  Patches welcome.

1. Install Python and PyMC.  Instructions:

2. Download and unpack the DisMod-MR code:
    https://github.com/aflaxman/gbd/archive/master.zip

3. Launch the IPython notebook with pylab inline:
    ipython notebook --pylab inline

4. View, modify, and/or run the replication example notebook in your
web browser.
